  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    The website's purpose is to convert one unit measurement to another. 
    Both the METRIC and IMPERIAL SYSTEMS include measuring options. Both 
    units of measurement may be converted to one another, making it extremely 
    handy. Validation is also added, such as the fact that only numbers are 
    permitted and that the number must be entered before clicking the convert button.
